# Flash Fluency

## About
Flash Fluency is a flashcard program for spaced repetition memorization. 

## Status
Flash Fluency is still unfinished! It currently functions as a private tool that I use to learn languages.
I plan to extend it to include a GUI and to support image- and audio-based flashcards, similar to [ANKI](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

That being said, I am quite content with the existing code, which is why this repository is public. Feel free to explore
and experiment with what's here!

## Media
Here are some screenshots from my own use of the program to learn [YorÃ¹bÃ¡](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language):

Taken from a review lesson. In this state, the program was set to be lenient towards improper accent placement.
Providing the answer `???` will end the lesson and not affect the status of flashcards that were not reviewed.

The program has various settings to customize the learning experience. Some of these can be overridden with deck tags.
For example, adding the tag `irreversible` to a deck will set `reverse_mode` to `false` when a lesson or test is taken in that deck.
